**Analysis of Thoraco-Lumbar Vertebrae Segmentation and Stress-Strain Behavior in Osteoporotic Intervertebral Discs**

This repository contains two PDF reports, each focusing on different aspects of spinal biomechanics. Below is a brief description of each report:

**1. Segmentation of the Thoraco-Lumbar Vertebrae (T12 and L1)**

The first report proposes the segmentation of the anatomical region comprising the thoracic vertebra T12 and the lumbar vertebra L1. The thoraco-lumbar junction is of particular interest as it is a common site for traumatic injuries, contributing to an estimated 30-60% of all spinal injuries. This work also investigates the differences between thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, with a specific focus on characterizing the vertebral body. Additionally, one of the segmented models will be used for Finite Element Method (FEM) analysis to be conducted in Abaqus.

**2. Numerical Analysis of Stress-Strain Behavior in Osteoporotic Intervertebral Discs**

The second report focuses on the numerical analysis of stress and strain in intervertebral discs in individuals with moderate to severe osteoporosis. The goal is to investigate whether, and how, the mechanical response of the intervertebral disc under compression loading differs from that of a healthy individual, considering the altered stress distribution within the vertebral bone caused by osteoporosis.
